# CookieFarm

**CookieFarm** is a Attack/Defense CTF framework inspired by DestructiveFarm, developed by the Italian team **ByteTheCookie**. What sets CookieFarm apart is its hybrid Go+Python architecture and "zero distraction" approach: **Your only task: write the exploit logic!**

The system automatically handles exploit distribution, flag submission, and result monitoring, allowing you to focus exclusively on writing effective exploits.

- [**`client/`**](./client/) – Directory dedicated to client logic (exploiting and submitting flag to the server)
- [**`server/`**](./server/) – Directory dedicated to server logic (handling exploit distribution, flag submission, and result monitoring)
