# 📜 CookieFarm Client Exploitation Guide

## 🔧 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- **Python 3+**
- **pip** for installing Python modules
- **Modern terminal** that supports ANSI colors and Unicode (for TUI mode)

---

## ⚙️ Client Installation

To install the CookieFarm client, run the following command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade cookiefarm requests
```

After installation, the `ckc` command will be globally available in your terminal. By default, it will launch in interactive TUI (Text User Interface) mode.

To uninstall the client:

```bash
pip uninstall cookiefarm
```

---

## 📺 Interface Options

The CookieFarm client has two interface modes:

1. **Interactive TUI Mode** (default): A colorful, user-friendly interface with menus and keyboard navigation
   ```bash
   ckc
   # TUI starts automatically
   ```

2. **Traditional CLI Mode**: For scripts, automation, or environments where TUI isn't supported
   ```bash
   ckc --help
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> If you add params at the end of the command, they will be parsed as CLI commands. For example:
> ```bash
> ckc config show
> # This will run the `config show` command in CLI mode.
> ```

## 🧪 Exploitation Workflow

1. **Install the client** using pip:
```bash
pip install --upgrade cookiefarm requests
```

2. **Log in** to the server:
   ```bash
   # In CLI mode (with no environment variable setted):
   ckc login -P SuperSecret -H 192.168.1.10 -p 8000 -u CookieMonster

   # In TUI mode:
   # Navigate to: Configuration → Login → Enter credentials
   ```

3. **Create a new exploit template**:
   ```bash
   # In CLI mode (with no environment variable setted):
   ckc exploit create -n my_exploit

   # In TUI mode:
   # Navigate to: Exploits → Create Exploit → Enter name
   ```

4. **Write your exploit** in the created file `~/.config/cookiefarm/exploits/my_exploit.py`.

5. **Run the exploit**:
   ```bash
   # In CLI mode (with no environment variable setted):
   ckc exploit run -e my_exploit.py -n CookieService -t 120 -W 40
   ```

## 🌟 TUI Navigation

The interactive TUI provides easy navigation with the following keyboard shortcuts:

| Key          | Action                         |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| ↑/↓ or j/k  | Navigate menu items            |
| Enter       | Select item or submit form     |
| ESC         | Go back to previous screen     |
| Tab         | Navigate between input fields  |
| q or Ctrl+C | Quit the application           |

The TUI offers these main views:
- **Main Menu**: Choose between Configuration and Exploit operations
- **Config Menu**: Configuration management commands
- **Exploit Menu**: Exploit management commands
- **Input Forms**: Fill in required parameters for commands
- **Output View**: See command results with syntax highlighting

## Detailed Command Usage

### Config Login Command
Authenticate with the server using a password:
```bash
# In CLI mode (with no environment variable setted):
ckc login -P <password> -H <server_ip> -p <port> -u <username>

# In TUI mode:
# Navigate to: Configuration → Login → Enter password
```

# In CLI mode (with no environment variable setted):
ckc config show

# In TUI mode:
# Navigate to: Configuration → Show Config
```

### Config Reset Command
Reset the configuration to default:
```bash

ckc config reset

# In TUI mode:
# Navigate to: Configuration → Reset Config
```

### Config Logout Command
Log out and clear the current session:
```bash
# In CLI mode (with no environment variable setted):
ckc logout

# In TUI mode:
# Navigate to: Configuration → Logout
```

---

### Exploit Create Command
Create a new exploit template:
```bash
# In CLI mode (with no environment variable setted):
ckc exploit create -n <exploit_name>

# In TUI mode:
# Navigate to: Exploits → Create Exploit → Enter name
```
Parameters:
- `-n <exploit_name>`: Name of the exploit template. This can be a path to a file or just a name.
> If user does not specify the path in the exploit name, it will be created in the `~/.config/cookiefarm/exploits/` directory. Otherwise, it will be created in the specified path.

*Example:*
```bash
# In CLI mode (with no environment variable setted):
ckc exploit create -n my_exploit

# In TUI mode:
# Navigate to: Exploits → Create Exploit → Enter name as `my_exploit`
```
In this case, the exploit will be created in the current directory.


### Exploit Test Command
Test an exploit against the NOP team:
```bash
# In CLI mode (with no environment variable setted):
ckc exploit test -e <exploit_file> -n <service_name> [-t <timeout>] [-W <workers>]
```
Parameters:
- `-e <exploit_file>`: Path to the exploit file (Python script).
- `-n <service_name>`: Name of the service to test the exploit against.
- `-t <timeout>`: Timeout for the exploit in seconds (default is 120).
- `-W <workers>`: Number of workers to use (default is 10).

### Exploit Run Command
Run an exploit:
```bash
# In CLI mode (with no environment variable setted):
ckc exploit run -e <exploit_file> -n <service_name> [-t <timeout>] [-W <workers>] [-D]

```
Parameters:
- `-e <exploit_file>`: Path to the exploit file (Python script).
- `-n <service_name>`: Name of the service to run the exploit against.
- `-t <timeout>`: Timeout for the exploit in seconds (default is 120).

*Example:*
```bash
# In CLI mode (with no environment variable setted):
ckc exploit run -e my_exploit.py -n CookieService -t 120 -W 40
# This will return the PID of the running exploit.
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> With the command `ckc exploit test` you can see all the print statements from the exploit script, which is useful for debugging and understanding how the exploit works, in the `ckc exploit run` command no.
